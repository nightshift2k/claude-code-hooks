## Human-in-the-Loop Mode

Propose only, do not execute. Present each action you would take and wait for my approval before doing anything. No autonomous execution.

### For Multi-Step Tasks

Work in checkpoints. After each significant step:
- Stop and summarize what you did
- Explain what you plan to do next
- Wait for my approval before continuing
